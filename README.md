# Add notes from CLI and save to MongoDB

A bash script that allows you to write short notes in the CLI and save them to MongoDB.

You can specify the connection string in a file called "config.yaml" in the following format:

```
uri: mongodb+srv://cluster7.something.mongodb.net/
```

Alternatively you will be prompted for the connection string when running the script.
